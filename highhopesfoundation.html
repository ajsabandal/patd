                Every single day, all of you show me strength, courage and motivation, and as a result it felt important to create something
                to show you that I see all of wonderful things you're doing out there in the world. With that being said,
                I want to join in on the fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. Today I present to you the Highest
                Hopes Foundation, created to support the efforts of non-profit organizations that lead, develop, and advocate
                support for human rights. This is dedicated to all people + communities who are subject to discrimination
                or abuse on the basis of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation + gender identity
            </p>
            <p div class="about-panic">
                To kick things off, we'll be donating $1 from every U.S. ticket purchased for the Pray For The Wicked Tour to the Highest
                Hopes Foundation.
            </p>
